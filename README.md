Hello, I am @TessaVu,

I am interested in GIS applications and implementing them into matters of the environment.
My research focuses on environmental/ecological gentrification and its correlation between populations/demographics, income, and green space,
toxic waste sites and its correlation among water, air pollution, and populations/demographics (work in progress)
and urban heat island's correlations with electricity expenditure and household building typesâ€”
all within Salt Lake County, Utah.

My next project would be focusing on domestic terrorism, specifically white supremacist crimes and the correlation between it and certain populations/demographics.
